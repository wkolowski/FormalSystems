(** * Computability Logic *)

(** This is an attempt at formalizing Giorgi Japaridze's Computability
    Logic based on "In the beginning was game semantics" from the book
    "Games: Unifying Logic, Language, and Philosophy".

    The approach is to replace Japaridze's "classical" definitions with
    mainly coinductive ones friendly to type theory. Currently it's
    rather experimental and certainly very broken, because he seems to
    define game operations by defining their structure and winner mutually
    at the same time. Here this would require mutual coinduction and I
    don't know how to do it properly. *)

Definition Elementary (g : Game) : Prop :=
  forall e : Valuation, ElementaryConstantGame (g e).

Definition depends (g : Game) (v : V) : Prop :=
  exists e1 e2 : Valuation,
    (forall v' : V, v' <> v -> e1 v' = e2 v') /\ g e1 <> g e2.

Lemma not_depends_ConstantGame :
  forall (g : ConstantGame) (v : V),
    ~ depends (fun _ => g) v.
Proof.
  unfold depends. intros g v [e1 [e2 [H1 H2]]]. contradiction.
Qed.
